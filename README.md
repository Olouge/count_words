# count_words
Implement a function count_words() in Python that takes as input a string s and a number n, and returns the n most frequently-occuring words in s. The return value should be a list of tuples - the top n words paired with their respective counts [(&lt;word>, &lt;count>), (&lt;word>, &lt;count>), ...], sorted in descending count order.
