# Count_words
Implementation of a function count_words() in Python that takes as input a string s and a number n, and returns the n most frequently-occuring words in s. The return value should be a list of tuples - the top n words paired with their respective counts [(&lt;word>, &lt;count>), (&lt;word>, &lt;count>), ...], sorted in descending count order.
# Contributing
May run a test with a couple of more words and study different outputs.
# Code status
Currenlty code outputs expected results but when submitting through the MLND platform, ann error message comes up though test run runs without errors and displays the expected output.
